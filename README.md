# HSK Flashcards

This is a personal project designed to help study for the HSK (Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi) Chinese language proficiency tests. While many online resources recommend Anki for flashcard study, I found its UI to be outdated with a steep learning curve. This project aims to provide a simple, user-friendly web application for studying HSK vocabulary. Enjoy!

You can access the live application [here](https://michcqge.github.io/HSK-Flashcards/).

## Features

- Clean, modern interface
- All HSK decks created, including Pinyin and English translations
- Web-based for easy access across devices
- Use arrow keys to navigate through words
- Use the space bar to flip the card
- Next words are randomized
